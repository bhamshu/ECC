#Elliptic Curve Cryptography
Discrete Logarithm Problem over Elliptic Curves is a computationally hard problem. No publically known attacks exist which can solve it in better than sqrt(N) complexity where N is the magnitude of the characteristic prime number of the field over which the discrete elliptic curve is defined. Thus, it is exponentially hard in the number of bits of the prime number.
